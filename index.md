Hello, world...

# What is this blog?

This is a software engineering blog.

I'm using it to help me consolidate everything I'm learning, in the hope that writing out my thoughts will help synthesise understanding or opinions. I could give it up at any moment. I'm starting it on 10/May/2025, and if you find this in 2026 or later and there's still only 1 post, you know what's happened. My goal is not for anyone to read this, but I'm publishing it because the fear of knowing that someone might stumble across it will make me write more clearly and refine my thinking.

This is not a portfolio. I have plenty of other projects I'd rather work on, so I'm sorry if you don't like the way it looks - neither do I.

I may not stick with this. I'll only keep writing as long as I feel that it is beneficial for my learning and the best use of my time. This is only for me, so unless something changes drastically I will not optimise this for page rank.

# Who am I?

If you've found this, you're likely a potential employer. If so, I'm impressed with the thoroughness of your due diligence!

If you're anyone else, maybe that means I've actually written something worth reading, and you want to know who I am. My name is Matt Vaughan-Jones. I'm self-taught and became a full-time software engineer in 2024 after landing my first role as a mid-level engineer in an amazing company called OVO Energy Australia. Before that, I graduated as a chemical and environmental engineer and worked in that field for a little while. I've also been a salesperson, a business development manager, marketing manager, head of IT, and head of sales. Outside of my career, I play a lot of sports and spend a great deal of time learning.
